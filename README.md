## Speech Recognition and Emotion Detection
This project is a real-time **Vocal Emotion Detection Application** built using deep learning.  
It analyzes **Speech/Audio Input** and predicts the underlying human emotion using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

The model extracts meaningful audio features (MFCC) and classifies the speaker's emotional state through a clean Streamlit web interface.
