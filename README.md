This project is a real-time **vocal emotion detection application** built using deep learning.  
It analyzes **speech/audio input** and predicts the underlying human emotion using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

The model extracts meaningful audio features (MFCC) and classifies the speaker's emotional state through a clean Streamlit web interface.
